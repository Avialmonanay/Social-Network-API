# Social Network API        
This Social Network API was built to demonstrate my ability to use MongoDB to create an API based social networking application. This application allows you to add users, thoughts, reactions, and friends and make the appropriate changes to those datasets that you expect to come with a social network application.

## Installation
This Application utilizes 2 NPM packages for Express and Mongoose. These can be downloaded by accessing the terminal of the application and running "npm i" that is all the configuration needed for this application. Once that is installed you can run the application and start making changes.

## Usage
This is an API application built with no front end UI. Users will have to interact with the application via api methods to get and modify data. Refer to the API documentation on this ReadMe for all API routes. When making api calls it is expected to have a response from the server with the requested information or an error if something whas inputted incorrectly by the user.
